## *Frames* and *backfires*

:::: columns

::: {.column width="60%" .fragment}

### What is a FRAME? {style="color:#3a9f9c"}

Frames are sets of choices about how information is presented. Effective framing requires:

- Knowing your audience
- Knowing what to lead with
- Selecting words that “fit your frame”
- Choosing what to leave unsaid

...even when contradictory evidence is provided.
