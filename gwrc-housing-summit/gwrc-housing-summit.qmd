# Supply

<br>*An abundance of homes for everyone*

## Supply problems

::: {.highlight-last}

- We've underbuilt for generations
- Restrictive zoning makes land more expensive
- Construction labor never recovered after 2008
- Interest rate, inflation, and supply chain issues abound

:::

[:arrow_forward: Half of all renters in the region are cost-burdened]{.fragment}

[:arrow_forward: First-time homebuyers are nearly priced out]{.fragment}

---

![](img/gwrc-zoning.png)

---

![](img/price-type.png)

## Supply solutions

<br>*What local governments can do:*

::: {.highlight-last}

- Use comprehensive plan updates to explore long-term density options
- Expand accessory dwelling units in residential districts
- Explore inclusionary zoning
- Permit by-right multifamily housing in more residential zones

:::

# Stability

<br>*Keeping homeowners and renters in place*

## Stability problems

::: {.highlight-last}

- Tight rental market doesn't incentivize property owners to make improvements
- Pandemic-era rental protections and assistance have expired
- No longer making significant progress on homelessness
- Seniors are a significant portion of current and future housing demand

:::

[:arrow_forward: Proactive intervention needed to avoid significant long-term costs]{.fragment}

---

![](img/pit.png)

---

![](img/mkv.png)

## Stability solutions

[:no_entry: Localities in Virginia have very few powers to regulate rents and tenants' rights]{.fragment}

[*What local governments can do:*]{.fragment}

::: {.highlight-last}

- Orient zoning and financial resources to make permanent support housing easier
- Increase housing rehab and critical home repair programs
- Revitalize manufactured home communities and replace poor quality homes
- Create a center for first time, low/moderate-income homebuyer readiness

:::

# Subsidy

<br>*Public investment to fill market gaps*

## Subsidy problems

::: {.highlight-last}

- Long-term shifts in federal policy place increasing responsibilities on states and local communities
- Only 7% of all the new homes built in the region over the past decade use public assistance to provide below-market rate rents
- Just a fraction of households eligible and in need of housing assistance actually receive any

[:arrow_forward: Local governments must get creative to supplement other resources]{.fragment}

:::

![](img/gap.png)

---

![](img/lihtc-exp.png)

## Subsidy solutions

<br>*What local governments can do:*

::: {.highlight-last}

- Establish local (or regional) housing trust funds
- Establish a regional housing consortium to pool federal housing resources
- Explore locally-run public development models
