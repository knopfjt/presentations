# Why is it so hard to talk about housing?

. . .

*(As explained by Homer.)*

---

## There's too much going on.

![](img/homer-confused.gif)

## Some people refuse any reality other than their own.

![](img/homer-genius.gif)

## Some people say things you wish you could unhear.

![](img/homer-bushes.gif)

## It's easy to get frustrated!

![](img/homer-hard.gif)

## So what can we do?

## Not to mention...

. . .

[Rising interest rates]{.absolute top=150 left=0}

. . .

[Labor and material costs]{.absolute top=350 left=0}

. . .

[Restrictive land use policies]{.absolute top=550 left=0}

. . .

[Lagging wages]{.absolute top=150 left=650}

. . .

[Workforce shortages]{.absolute top=350 left=650}

. . .

[Private equity acquisitions]{.absolute top=550 left=650}

## Where does this leave us?

. . .

Accelerating prices reflect lack of supply across the spectrum.

. . . 

Long-term shifts in federal policy place increasing responsibilities on states and local communities.

. . .

It's hard to plan for the future when we're still solving the past.

# A broken housing market makes things tough for everyone.

## *Frames* and *backfires*

:::: columns

::: {.column width="60%" .fragment}

### What is a FRAME? {style="color:#3a9f9c"}

Frames are sets of choices about how information is presented. Effective framing requires:

- Knowing your audience
- Knowing what to lead with
- Selecting words that “fit your frame”
- Choosing what to leave unsaid

:::

::: {.column width="40%" .fragment}

### How can it BACKFIRE? {style="color:#e66b3f"}

A message ***backfires*** when it reinforces the audience’s existing biases, rather than changing them...

...even when contradictory evidence is provided.

# What you should remember

- “Affordable” is just the start of the conversation
- Take advantage of increasing attention on housing issues
- How you talk about housing matters
- We’re making more progress than you might think — but lots more to do
