# Why is it so hard to talk about housing?

. . .

*(As explained by Homer.)*

## There's too much going on.

![](img/homer-confused.gif)

## Some people refuse any reality other than their own.

![](img/homer-genius.gif)

## Some people say things you wish you could unhear.

![](img/homer-bushes.gif)

## It's easy to get frustrated!

![](img/homer-hard.gif)

## So what can we do?

. . .

:books: Know your facts and history

. . .

:hammer: Focus on solutions
