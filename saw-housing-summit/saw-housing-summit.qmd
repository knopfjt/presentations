# Why is it so hard to talk about housing?

. . .

*(As explained by Homer.)*

---

## There's too much going on.

![](img/homer-confused.gif)

## Some people refuse any reality other than their own.

![](img/homer-genius.gif)

## Some people say things you wish you could unhear.

![](img/homer-bushes.gif)

## It's easy to get frustrated!

## So what can we do?

## *Frames* and *backfires*

:::: columns

::: {.column width="60%" .fragment}

### What is a FRAME? {style="color:#3a9f9c"}

Frames are sets of choices about how information is presented. Effective framing requires:

- Knowing your audience
- Knowing what to lead with
- Selecting words that “fit your frame”
- Choosing what to leave unsaid

:::

::: {.column width="40%" .fragment}

### How can it BACKFIRE? {style="color:#e66b3f"}

A message ***backfires*** when it reinforces the audience’s existing biases, rather than changing them...

...even when contradictory evidence is provided.

:::

::::

## Common backfires

::: columns

:::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}

### "Traditional" message {style="color:#3a9f9c"}

*John and Mary need our help. They are trying to overcome addiction and homelessness. They need an affordable home and counseling support.*

::::

:::: {.column width="50%"}

::::: {.fragment}

### PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY {style="color:#B1005F"}

*They should stop making poor decisions. Don’t ask me to pay for their mistakes.*

:::::

::::: {.fragment}

### ZERO-SUM THINKING {style="color:#B1005F"}

*I feel bad for them, but it’s got nothing to do with me. It’s not my responsibility to solve their problems.*

End explanations with clear, actionable remedies to keep focus on *how* we can fix our problems.
