Housing Costs and Homelessness. I was thinking you could draw from the work of the CoC Strategic Plan lead by HDAdvisors and quote provide insights on the number of rent-burdened households and the number of units needed. Perhaps note the GAO's finding that a $100 median increase in rents was associated with a 9% increase in homelessness in areas it studied. Whatever you think provides some high-level insight on the landscape we are in as a homeless services provider.
